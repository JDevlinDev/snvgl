<h1 align="center">Simple and Non-Versatile Graphics Library</h1>

<br/>

## 🔭 Overview

**SNVGL** is a free and open-source UI library that enables you to easily create graphical user experiences for the ESP-32 with the cheapest and most popular monochrome OLED on the market. It removes the headache that comes with the versatility of libraries like SVGL, allowing entry-level ESP-IDF makers to easily spin up interesting and simple UIs, animations, and explore the functionality of a fun and accessible component without all the hassle.

## 🤡 Features

- Not portable even slightly: You don't need to worry about what "portable" even means. Just set your SDL and SCA pins via running `idf.py menuconfig` in your project.
- Simple to use: What the hell is an SSD1306? You don't need to care.
- Ridigly inflexible: No style system. No fonts. Right now you can just make a point, a line, or a box.
- Highly Scalable: You can put it on as many ESP32s as you want.

## Usage

## 📦️ Platform Support

SNVGL has no platform support besides ESP32. That's kind of the point.
